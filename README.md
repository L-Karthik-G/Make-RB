# 🛣️ Make Roads Better (Make RB)

**Make Roads Better (Make RB)** is an Android-based pothole detection application that helps identify and report road potholes using real-time accelerometer and GPS data from your mobile device.  
The goal is to make roads safer by collecting and sharing data about poor road conditions with drivers and authorities.

---

## 🚗 Overview

The app continuously analyzes changes in the **Z-axis acceleration** (the up–down movement of your phone) to detect potholes.  
When a sudden spike or drop is detected within a defined threshold, the app marks that as a potential pothole and records its **GPS location**.

This data is stored in a central database and used to display potholes along your **current route or destination**, helping users avoid rough road segments.

## 🛰️ How It Works

1. Continuously monitors **accelerometer data** from the phone.  
2. Detects potholes based on sudden changes in vertical acceleration.  
3. Records the **GPS coordinates** of each detected pothole.  
4. Sends the information to a **central database**.  
5. Displays reported potholes along your route or destination in real time.
